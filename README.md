# SoundTemple
A PWA that makes TempleOS-like music from English poems.
  - ❌ No frameworks like React or Vue
  - ⚡ Uses WebAssembly for fast graphics and audio rendering

Test it over at [my website](https://portasynthinca3.me/soundtemple).

Build it yourself with:
```bash
# Install clang and lld first!
$ git clone https://github.com/portasynthinca3/soundtemple.git
$ cd soundtemple
$ pnpm i
$ pnpm build
```
⚡ This project uses a `pnpm` lockfile and thus all commands above _must_ be run with `pnpm` and not `npm`.
